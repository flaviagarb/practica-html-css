  - First Name (required)
  - Last Name (required)
  - Phone Number (required)
  - Radio buttons for "How did you meet me?" (required options: University, Keepcoding Kick-off, School, On GitHub)
  - A GitHub tag input validated with the regex `^@[^\s]+` (for @username)
  - A textarea for additional user information (max 180 characters, required)
  - A newsletter subscription checkbox
  - A Save (submit) button and a Reset button
- A **footer** with external links to social networks.
- A burguer menu only with CSS and html, using input checkbox for responsive mobile.
- An additional page: Projects, featuring a **video** that plays on entry and appears with a fade-in animation and displaying a grid layout of projects.
- An additional page 404.

## Key Features

- **CSS Animations:**
  - Progress bars animate from 0% to their target value.
  - Smooth hover transitions on navigation links.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Media queries adjust the banner and navigation for mobile devices.

- **Form Validation:**
  - Correct input types (e.g., `tel`, `text`, `url`) and HTML attributes like `required`, `pattern`, and `maxlength` ensure data integrity.
  - Regular expression validation for the GitHub tag (`@username`).

- **External Links:**
  - The footer contains links to social networks such as Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

- **(Optional) Burger Menu with Pure CSS:**
  - Uses an `input type="checkbox"` and a corresponding `label` to toggle navigation without JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. **Main Navigation**
   - The header contains navigation links to various sections (e.g., Skills, Contact).
   - On smaller screens, these links can be hidden or replaced with an optional burger menu.

2. **Skills Section**
   - Check out the animated progress bars that represent Nick Millerâ€™s skills.
   - Each bar gradually fills up to visually demonstrate proficiency levels.

3. **Contact Form**
   - Fill in all required fields: first name, last name, phone number, how you met Nick Miller, GitHub tag (validated with regex `^@[^\s]+`), and additional information.
   - Optionally subscribe to the newsletter via the checkbox.
   - Use the Save button to submit or the Reset button to clear the form.

4. **Video Page**
   - Contains a video that plays automatically and appears with a fade-in effect.

5. **Projects Page**
   - Displays a grid of projects, showcasing layouts achieved with CSS Grid.
